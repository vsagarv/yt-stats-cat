============

This is a cat. It may get curious about YouTube stats for video(s), channel(s) and other things.

I. Let's get Go library for YT APIs.

  1. go get code.google.com/p/google-api-go-client
  2. read the examples code
  3. go install merrily
  4. play with the examples to get a hang of Go and the APIs
  5. [fun part] there are no youtube examples there; so go read the API code

II. Once you feel adventurous, go {hack, test, repeat} until done.
